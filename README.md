I created this simple app thinking about my husband, who has a hard time making decisions. It randomly responds to a user's question. I used Math.random() to generate the random response when a question is entered.    
It's an exercise to help me better understand eventListeners and how to add and remove classes so that elements are hidden/displayed.
