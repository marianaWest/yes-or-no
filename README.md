# yes-or-no
I created this simple app thinking about my husband, who has a hard time making decisions. It randomly responds to a user's question. I used Math.random() to generate the random response when a question is entered. For this light-hearted app with only four possible outcomes, the Fisher-Yates shuffle would be overkill.  
It's an exercise to help me better understand eventListeners and how to add and remove classes so that elements are hidden/displayed. 

I'm sure I can refactor it in the near future, for instance, by replacing buttons with other elements.
